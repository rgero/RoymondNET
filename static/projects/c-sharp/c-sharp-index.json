I located a few courses on Udemy and Coursera that would teach me the frameworks for Monogame and Unity. Both platforms were driven by C#."},

Having worked with Java in some projects, I felt that this would be an easy transition and with the aid of these courses, I was able to quickly get rolling within both of these frameworks."},
