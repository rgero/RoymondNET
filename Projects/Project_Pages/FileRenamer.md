### History

The File Renamer was the first GUI-based project I ever attempted using Visual Studio and C# Forms. I started working on it on September 17th, 2015 to solve an issue I was experiencing with my digital camera. The issue was that when the camera had taken 1000 pictures, it would create a new folder and name the next picture taken "Pic001.jpg." This meant that when I would combine them into a single folder the newer photos would attempt to overwrite the older ones.

### Looking back now

It's always interesting to look back at a project like this. I remember it took me a weekend to complete and I was rather proud of it at the time. I also worked on a separate executable that would allow someone to run it from the command line. I will say that since this project, I have not tried to write a similar application. Every time I have worked with a user interface, it has been either through a game engine, such as Unity or Monogame, or a framework like Javaâ€™s Swing. I find these options to be much more preferable, but that might be because I am more experienced with them.

If I were to do this project again I would spend a lot more time on the UI. I feel that it was a combination of inexperience with UI design at the time and my inexperience with the framework that led to the result we have for this project. I do believe that I have come a decent way with my more recent GUI projects.
