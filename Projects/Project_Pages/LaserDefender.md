### About the Project

Laser defender is the first Unity project I actively worked on after taking the Complete Unity Developer Course (link). It is a top down space shooter in a similar vain as Space Invaders. I was looking for something that would be easy to create and rather well known to put my spin on.

Unfortunately, I stopped working on this project about two years ago. It was one of those projects that I intended on picking up again when I got some time, but it eventually got put so far down on the list that I just never returned to it. However, I do feel that it was a rather valid project and a good example of one of where I started with Unity.
