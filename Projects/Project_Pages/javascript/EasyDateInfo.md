### Easy Date information

This extension is the second one I've written for Google Chrome and was initially released on June 14th, 2017. The purpose of the extension is to provide some additional information about the date to the user in a way that is easy and convenient. The idea came to me because I often need to look up what is the week number is. The process of determining the week number isn't that difficult, often a quick Google search would suffice but when you are drafting an email and trying to rush to a meeting or out the door, seconds matter.

After talking to a couple of my friends and coworkers, I determined the first set of criteria (because honestly, just providing the week number was not enough). The initial release consists of Week Number, Day Number, current day of the week and days until your next pay day.

This was also the first time that I dove extensively into JavaScript Prototypes. I added several functions to the Date type for the purpose of this project. I was actually really surprised with this capability and enjoyed it a bunch. I never really expected to enjoy anything involving JavaScript mainly because I have often struggled with debugging any issues that come up. This project extended many opportunities to hone my skills in that area, and I learned a fair number of tricks to make the process far less painful.
