### Amazon to Smile!

This is the first extension for Google Chrome I have written. The purpose of this extension is to automatically redirect anyone who goes to Amazon.com to AmazonSmile (For more information about Amazon Smile, please check out this link). The reason I wrote this extension is because I often would go to Amazon.com and make a purchase and then realize as I was checking out that I could have used AmazonSmile. After this realization, I'd often change the web address before completing the transaction. The catch is that I rarely would notice I was on the wrong site.

It felt like it was an appropriate size for a first attempt at an extension and it is definitely something I've gotten a lot of benefit out of.
