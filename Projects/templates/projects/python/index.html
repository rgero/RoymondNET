          <h2>Python</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Python was the first programming language I tried to learn after college. I remember that I was looking through some reddit posts for ways to curb my boredom on a slow day in the office. One post had a list of websites that was meant for those who were looking to develop their skills in various aspects of life. While I was looking through this list I stumbled upon CodeAcademy.com. At the time, they were advertising their new Python 2.7 course and I remember saying why not?

            <P>I completed the entire course in a couple days. I remember being captivated by the silly humor that littered the course as well as how easy it was to complete the tasks. Before I knew it, I was branching off on my own and writing little scripts to do things and even a rather simple CLI game.

            <P>Python quickly became one of my go to languages to write small programs in. My manager became aware of my abilities to use Python and since then Iâ€™ve been using it quite a bit in my daily work life.
